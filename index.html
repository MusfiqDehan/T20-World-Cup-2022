                    <p>
                        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the
                        centre of which is a 20-metre (10-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two
                        batsmen and a bowler. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball with the bat, while the
                        bowling side bowls the ball with the wicket. The game is played at the old-style international
                        format, which is played on a rectangular field with a length of 110 metres (42 yards) and a
                        width of 65 metres (27 yards).
